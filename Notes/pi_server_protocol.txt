This is all assuming the server will be running on private network. If we rent a server + get a domain name we should just use SSL and a self signed certificate.

Pis will store a token. This will identify them to the server and will
associate the pi with a house and room (after setup). This will prevent needing to
re setup the system in case of power failure, broken connection etc.

Problem: how do we get token onto pi?

A solution: {
give the pis set ID numbers. Put a physical label/NFC tag/QR code on the pi/camera device. This label should represent the ID.

When connecting to the server for the first time, PI sends ID number. Server goes into "pairing mode" where it waits for someone connected to the web client to enter this ID (hence the physical label). After timeout, server closes connection.
}

After this, server knows which house/account the pi is associated with.

This is a potential protocol for setting up secure communication between Pis and the Pi Server. It relies on the pis having the servers genuine public key. Pis will need to be secure so that an attacker can't change the pis version of the public key.

Pi -> Server: [N, Ks]{Spub}
Server -> Pi: [N+1]{Ks} --only server can get Ks, so 
Pi -> Server: [token || ID]{Ks}
Server -> Pi: [ACK || NACK || token]{Ks}
Pi -> Server: [Data]{Ks}
